Implementation of a Chess Engine in Java 
This project was part of the bachelor's degree at Hochschule Trier University of Applied Science. 
The motivation was highly created by Sebastian Lague's video about chess: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk&t=939s .

Features of this project: 
- Two simillar approaches of a chess ai, including a OpeningBook, Alpha-Beta-Search, Evaluating Function and more. 
- The game chess itsself.
- Parser for FEN-Strings (FEN-Strings describe a board position).
- Parser for PGN files (Portable-Game-Notation)
