<h1> Implementation of a Chess Engine in Java </h1>
This project was part of the bachelor's degree at Hochschule Trier University of Applied Sciences. It was greatly inspired by Sebastian Lague's video about chess (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk&t=939s). The features of this project include:

- Two different approaches to developing a chess AI, incorporating an Opening Book, Alpha-Beta Search, Iterative Deepening, evaluation functions, among other features.
- The game chess itself, with all special rules like castling or en passant.
- A parser for FEN (Forsyth-Edwards-Notation) strings to play against the AIs with a custom board.
- A parser for PGN (Portable Game Notation) files, used in the opening book.

<b> Requirements </b> 
- JavaFX 11+
- Java SE 16 (lower versions may also work)
